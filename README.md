# Team 4: 4est

Welcome to the repository for team 4, **4est**, part of ESIIL and Earth Lab's Forest Carbon Codefest. This repository is the central hub for our team, encompassing our project overview, team member information, codebase, and more.

## Our Project
Our project aims to answer the question: where are sawmills in Colorado and Wyoming? Addressing this question had two components: 1) identifying the locations of known sawmills in Colorado and Wyoming by integrating and verifying different existing datasets and adding them to [Open Street Map (OSM)](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/craft=sawmill#map) for public access, and b) testing different machine learning algorithms' abilities to detect sawmills. 

## Documentation
- Access detailed documentation on our [GitHub Pages site](https://cu-esiil.github.io/FCC24_Group_4/).


## Group Members
- Member 1: Elizabeth Buhr is a field manager and junior programmer in the Forest Futures Lab at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. Her work focuses on post-fire forest regeneration in the boreal region of Interior Alaska.
- Member 2: Max Joseph is a data scientist at Planet Labs who estimates forest structure with remote sensing and machine learning. 
- Member 3: Hutch Tyree
- Member 4: Kit Lewers is PhD Student in Information Science and Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology at University of Colorado Boulder. Her research focuses on how information overload impacts institutions grounded in big data and the affects of disciplinary silos on open science and collaboration.

## Code Repository Structure
- **Data Processing**: "OSM points.ipynb" searches the Open Street Maps (OSM) database for entries matching "craft=sawmill" or "industrial=sawmill" in Colorado and Wyoming.
- **Analysis Code**: Scripts for data analysis, statistical modeling, etc.
- **Visualization**: Code for creating figures, charts, and interactive visualizations.

## Meeting Notes and Agendas
- Regular updates to keep all group members informed and engaged with the project's progress and direction.
