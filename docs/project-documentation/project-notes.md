# Project discussion notes

## Virtual meeting #3

### Team theme, tentative area of interest, or question: We were tentatively interested in forest state change.

## Day 1: March 12, 2024 - CU Boulder

### Selected scientific question: Where are sawmills? What can we do using this data?

## Day 2: March 13, 2024 - CU Boulder

### We found sawmills that were unmapped on Open Street Map (OSM) and added them to OSM. We used the samgeo package in Python to test different methods (text prompts, input prompts, and automatic mask generator) of identifying wood piles.
